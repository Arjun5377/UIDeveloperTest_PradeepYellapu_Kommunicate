The first person whom I'm gonna choose is someone who can contribute to the growth of the product building - At the end, Product is the key item which the entire company is dependent on, and there has to be a proper research & development in an iterative way. So A person who has proper technical knowledge would be a proper fit.
And the other person would be someone who possess good marketing skills which can help us taking our product to every inch of the targetted audience. so the person who has proper Soft & Managerial skills would be a proper fit.

So, Considering these Aspects, these aree the two persons I would like to choose fromn my class : Shravan Suresh(He posses a very good managerial skills) & Chirag Bhatia(Gives proper technical support).
